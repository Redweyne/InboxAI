## Environment Setup

### Required Secrets (CRITICAL - App won't work without these!)

This app requires three environment variables to function. When importing/exporting this project, these secrets are NOT included in the files for security reasons. You must add them manually in any new environment.

**On Replit:**
Add these as Secrets in the Replit environment (use the Secrets tab in the Tools panel):

1. **`GEMINI_API_KEY`** - Google Gemini AI API key
   - Powers the AI chat assistant
   - Get it FREE at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Click "Get API Key" → "Create API Key"

2. **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`** - Google OAuth Client ID
   - Enables Gmail and Calendar integration
   - Get it from: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Instructions in `.env.example` file

3. **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`** - Google OAuth Client Secret
   - Works with Client ID for authentication
   - Same source as Client ID

**On Other Platforms:**
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your actual values.

### Optional Integrations (Already Configured)
- Google Mail integration
- Google Calendar integration

## User Preferences
- Using free AI options (Gemini AI) due to no capital budget
- AI should understand the Inbox AI software and be helpful to users
- Focus on providing intelligent, context-aware assistance

## Development
The application runs on port 5000 with:
- Frontend: Vite dev server
- Backend: Express server with hot reload via tsx

Run: `npm run dev`

## VPS Subpath Deployment

For deploying to a subpath (e.g., `redweyne.com/InboxAI`), the application now supports the `APP_BASE_PATH` environment variable.

### Required VPS Environment Variables
```env
APP_BASE_PATH=/inboxai
APP_URL=https://redweyne.com
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://redweyne.com/inboxai/api/auth/google/callback
```

### How It Works
- API routes are mounted at `${APP_BASE_PATH}/api` (e.g., `/inboxai/api`)
- OAuth callbacks include the base path in the redirect URI
- Client-side routing uses the same base path

See `VPS_SUBPATH_API_FIX.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

## AI Capabilities
The Gemini AI assistant can:

### Read & Analyze:
- Summarize emails and identify urgent messages
- Find free time slots in your calendar
- Answer questions about emails and meetings
- Provide insights about email patterns
- Suggest next actions based on context

### Take Actions:
- ✉️ **Send emails** on your behalf
- 📧 **Modify emails**: Mark as read/unread, star, archive, or delete
- 📅 **Manage calendar**: Create, update, or delete events
- 🤖 **Automated assistance**: Just ask in natural language and the AI will execute

### How to Use Actions:
Simply ask the AI in natural language:
- "Send an email to john@example.com with subject 'Meeting Follow-up' and body 'Thanks for the meeting!'"
- "Mark all unread emails as read"
- "Create a calendar event for tomorrow at 2pm called 'Team Meeting'"
- "Delete that spam email from earlier"

The AI will detect your intent and execute the action automatically!
